3. Perform the logical database design, i.e. transform the conceptual schema given above into a collection of relational schemas.
4. Assume that the superset method must be used to transform a generalization hierarchy.
5. For each relational schema created clearly list the names of attributes, primary key, candidate keys (if any), and foreign keys (if any).
